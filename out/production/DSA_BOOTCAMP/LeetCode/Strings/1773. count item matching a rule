1773. Count Items Matching a Rule

You are given an array items, where each items[i] = [typei, colori, namei] describes the type, color, and name of the ith item.
You are also given a rule represented by two strings, ruleKey and ruleValue.
The ith item is said to match the rule if one of the following is true:

ruleKey == "type" and ruleValue == typei.
ruleKey == "color" and ruleValue == colori.
ruleKey == "name" and ruleValue == namei.
Return the number of items that match the given rule.

Example 1:
Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "color", ruleValue = "silver"
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one item matching the given rule, which is ["computer","silver","lenovo"].

Example 2:
Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","phone"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "type", ruleValue = "phone"
Output: 2
Explanation: There are only two items matching the given rule, which are ["phone","blue","pixel"] and ["phone","gold","iphone"]. Note that the item ["computer","silver","phone"] does not match.


Constraints:

1 <= items.length <= 104
1 <= typei.length, colori.length, namei.length, ruleValue.length <= 10
ruleKey is equal to either "type", "color", or "name".
All strings consist only of lowercase letters.

class Solution {
    public int countMatches(List<List<String>> items, String ruleKey, String ruleValue) {
        int count=0;
        for(List<String> item : items){
            if(ruleKey.equals("type") && item.get(0).equals(ruleValue)){
                count++;
            }else if(ruleKey.equals("color") && item.get(1).equals(ruleValue)){
                count++;
            }else if(ruleKey.equals("name") && item.get(2).equals(ruleValue)){
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}




Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize a counter variable to 0.
2. Iterate through each item in the items array.
3. Check if the ruleKey is "type" and the ruleValue is equal to the type of the current item.
4. If the condition in step 3 is true, increment the counter variable by 1.
5. Check if the ruleKey is "color" and the ruleValue is equal to the color of the current item.
6. If the condition in step 5 is true, increment the counter variable by 1.
7. Check if the ruleKey is "name" and the ruleValue is equal to the name of the current item.
8. If the condition in step 7 is true, increment the counter variable by 1.
9. After iterating through all the items, return the value of the counter variable.
