2129. Capitalize the Title

You are given a string title consisting of one or more words separated by a single space, where each word consists of English letters.
 Capitalize the string by changing the capitalization of each word such that:

If the length of the word is 1 or 2 letters, change all letters to lowercase.
Otherwise, change the first letter to uppercase and the remaining letters to lowercase.
Return the capitalized title.

Example 1:
Input: title = "capiTalIze tHe titLe"
Output: "Capitalize The Title"
Explanation:
Since all the words have a length of at least 3, the first letter of each word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase.

Example 2:
Input: title = "First leTTeR of EACH Word"
Output: "First Letter of Each Word"
Explanation:
The word "of" has length 2, so it is all lowercase.
The remaining words have a length of at least 3, so the first letter of each remaining word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase.

Example 3:
Input: title = "i lOve leetcode"
Output: "i Love Leetcode"
Explanation:
The word "i" has length 1, so it is lowercase.
The remaining words have a length of at least 3, so the first letter of each remaining word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase.

Constraints:
1 <= title.length <= 100
title consists of words separated by a single space without any leading or trailing spaces.
Each word consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and is non-empty

class Solution {
    public String capitalizeTitle(String title) {

        // SC = O(n)
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String[] newTitle = title.split(" ");
         // Split the title into words

        for(String word : newTitle) {
            if(word.length() <= 2) {
                sb.append(word.toLowerCase());
                 // If the word has 1 or 2 letters, convert to lowercase
            } else {
                sb.append(Character.toUpperCase(word.charAt(0)));
                // Capitalize the first letter
                sb.append(word.substring(1).toLowerCase());
                // Convert the rest to lowercase
            }

            sb.append(" ");
            // Add a space between words
        }

        return sb.toString().trim();
        // Remove the trailing space and return the result
    }
}


Split the input string into individual words using the space (" ") as the delimiter.
Create a new StringBuilder to store the capitalized words.
Iterate through each word in the list.
Capitalize the first character of each word using the toUpperCase() method on the first character.
Append the capitalized word to the StringBuilder.
Return the final capitalized title as a string.
