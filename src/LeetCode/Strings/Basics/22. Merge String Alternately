1768. Merge Strings Alternately

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other,
 append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.
Return the merged string.

Example 1:
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r

Example 2:
Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s

Example 3:
Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q
merged: a p b q c   d

Constraints:
1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100
word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters

class Solution {
    public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {
        int i=0;
        int j=0;
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        while(i<word1.length() || j<word2.length()){
            if(i<word1.length()){
                result.append(word1.charAt(i));
                i++;
            }
            if(j<word2.length()){
                result.append(word2.charAt(j));
                j++;
            }
        }
        return result.toString();
    }
}


1. Initialize two pointers, i and j, to 0.
2. Initialize an empty string, result, to store the merged string.
3. Iterate while either i is less than the length of the first string or j is less than the length of the second string:
       - If i is less than the length of the first string, append the character at index i in the first string to result and increment i by 1.
       - If j is less than the length of the second string, append the character at index j in the second string to result and increment j by 1.
4. Return the merged string.
