1252. Cells with Odd Values in a Matrix

There is an m x n matrix that is initialized to all 0's. There is also a 2D array indices where each indices[i] = [ri, ci] represents a 0-indexed location to perform some increment operations on the matrix.
For each location indices[i], do both of the following:
Increment all the cells on row ri.
Increment all the cells on column ci.
Given m, n, and indices, return the number of odd-valued cells in the matrix after applying the increment to all locations in indices.

Example 1:
Input: m = 2, n = 3, indices = [[0,1],[1,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Initial matrix = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]].
After applying first increment it becomes [[1,2,1],[0,1,0]].
The final matrix is [[1,3,1],[1,3,1]], which contains 6 odd numbers.

Example 2:
Input: m = 2, n = 2, indices = [[1,1],[0,0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Final matrix = [[2,2],[2,2]]. There are no odd numbers in the final matrix.

Constraints:
1 <= m, n <= 50
1 <= indices.length <= 100
0 <= ri < m
0 <= ci < n
*/

class Solution {
    public int oddCells(int m, int n, int[][] indices) {
        int[][] matrix = new int[m][n];

    for (int[] index : indices) {
        int ri = index[0];
        int ci = index[1];

        // Increment all elements in row ri
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            matrix[ri][j]++;
        }

        // Increment all elements in column ci
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            matrix[i][ci]++;
        }
    }

        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
             for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
               if (matrix[i][j] % 2 != 0) {
                count++;
               }
            }
        }
        return count;
   }
}




1. Initialize a 2D matrix matrix of size m x n with all elements set to 0.
2. Iterate through each pair of indices [ri, ci] in the indices array.
3. Increment all elements in row ri by 1 by iterating through each column and incrementing matrix[ri][j] by 1.
4. Increment all elements in column ci by 1 by iterating through each row and incrementing matrix[i][ci] by 1.
5. After applying the increments, count the number of odd-valued cells in the matrix by iterating through each element and incrementing a counter if matrix[i][j] is odd.
6. Return the count as the result.
